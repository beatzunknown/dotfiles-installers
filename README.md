# dotfile & installers

The goal is to keep my dotfiles and installer scripts (for setting up new OS installs with necessary tooling) in a centralised repo.

At the moment the installation scripts are kinda overloaded and in future I may separate them more. Eg: an installation script just for setting up `neovim`.
